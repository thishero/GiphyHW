# GiphyHW

This is an assignment that provides an array of animal buttons that provide 10 gifs (and content rating) for each corresponding button. If you would like to see gif's for an animal that is not already provided, simply type an animal into the "Add an animal" input field and click submit. This creates a new animal button for you to click upon and generate 10 new animal-specific gifs.
